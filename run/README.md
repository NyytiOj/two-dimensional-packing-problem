| end_layout.20                     | Data file that contains the details of the rectangle layout after SA simulation                          |
| SA.30                             | Data file that has documented the Area as a function of constant parameter                               |

| plot_simulation.py                | Python program that plots the beginning and ending layout and the area as a function of constantparameter|



!Notice that for the program to run correctly, the compilation should be done inside the folder finalproject!

Execution:
`````````````````````````````````
./run/two_dim_packing_problem.out
`````````````````````````````````


If the python file does not run upon execution you can run it with the next command:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
python3 run/plot_simulation.py
